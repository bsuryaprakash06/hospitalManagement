## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)

### 1. Introduction
The **Hospital Management System** is designed to automate the processes of a hospital including patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor allocation, billing, and record maintenance. It ensures smooth coordination between patients, doctors, and administrative staff, improving efficiency and service quality.

### 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a system that manages hospital operations digitally. It helps maintain accurate medical records, reduces manual paperwork, and provides easy access to patient and doctor information.

### 3. Scope
This system covers:
- Patient registration and management  
- Doctor and staff management  
- Appointment scheduling  
- Billing and payment management  
- Medical record maintenance  
- Hospital administration and reporting  

---

### 4. Functional Requirements
- **Patient Registration:** Add and manage patient personal and medical details.  
- **Doctor Management:** Maintain doctor profiles, schedules, and specializations.  
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Book, reschedule, or cancel patient appointments.  
- **Billing System:** Generate bills and manage payments for services provided.  
- **Medical Records:** Store and retrieve patient treatment history and prescriptions.  
- **Staff Management:** Manage roles, shifts, and details of hospital staff.  
- **Report Generation:** Generate reports for hospital performance, patients, and billing.  

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Ensure confidentiality of patient medical records and secure access control.  
- **Reliability:** Maintain accurate and consistent data throughout hospital operations.  
- **Performance:** System should handle multiple user requests efficiently.  
- **Usability:** Interface should be intuitive for patients, doctors, and administrators.  
- **Availability:** The system must be operational at all times, especially during emergencies.  

---

### 6. System Actors
- **Patient:** Registers, books appointments, views records, and makes payments.  
- **Doctor:** Views patient details, updates diagnoses, and manages appointments.  
- **Receptionist:** Handles patient registration, billing, and appointment scheduling.  
- **Administrator:** Manages the hospital system, staff, and overall operations.  

---

### 7. Use Cases
The main use cases of the Hospital Management System include:
1. Register Patient  
2. Manage Doctor Details  
3. Schedule Appointment  
4. Generate Bill  
5. View Medical Records  
6. Manage Staff Details  
7. Generate Reports  
8. Update Patient Information  

Each use case represents how different actors interact with the system to complete a hospital operation.
